# AI Companion Platform - Setup Complete

## What Was Fixed

The "cannot create room" error has been resolved by creating a complete database schema and fixing several critical issues:

### 1. Database Schema Created ✓
All required tables have been created with proper structure:
- **companions**: Stores AI companion profiles
- **video_rooms**: Manages video call sessions
- **messages**: Stores chat messages during calls
- **call_recordings**: Stores recording metadata
- **conversation_memories**: Stores conversation history for context retention

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Enabled ✓
All tables have RLS policies that:
- Allow authenticated users to access only their own data
- Allow public read access to active companions
- Protect sensitive user data and conversation history
- Ensure proper authorization for all operations

### 3. Storage Bucket Created ✓
Created "recordings" bucket for storing call recordings with proper policies

### 4. Environment Files Created ✓
- `frontend/.env` - Contains Supabase credentials and backend URL
- `backend/.env` - Contains Supabase service key and API keys

### 5. Backend Fixes Applied ✓
- Fixed response data access using `maybeSingle()` instead of `single()`
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Fixed null checks before accessing response data
- Improved error messages for debugging

### 6. Frontend Fixes Applied ✓
- Enhanced error handling in API calls
- Added detailed error logging
- Improved error messages displayed to users

## Setup Instructions for Production

### 1. Backend Configuration

Update `/backend/.env` with your API keys:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://kvvhxmlzfymdrbntglww.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=[your-service-key-here]
GEMINI_API_KEY=[your-gemini-api-key]
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=[your-elevenlabs-api-key]
DID_API_KEY=[your-did-api-key]
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
PORT=8000
```

### 2. Frontend Configuration

Update `/frontend/.env` for production:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://kvvhxmlzfymdrbntglww.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your-anon-key]
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
VITE_WS_URL=wss://your-backend-domain.com
```

### 3. Deploy Backend

The backend can be deployed to Render.com (configuration already in `backend/render.yaml`):

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect Render.com to your repository
3. Use the render.yaml configuration
4. Set environment variables in Render dashboard

### 4. Deploy Frontend

The frontend can be deployed to Vercel (configuration already in `frontend/vercel.json`):

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy

### 5. Sync Companions

After deployment, sync AI companions from the external API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-backend-domain.com/api/companions/sync
```

Or visit the backend and the system will auto-sync companions when you fetch them.

## Testing Locally

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

Backend will run on http://localhost:8000

### 3. Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run on http://localhost:5173

### 4. Test the Flow

1. Sign up or login at http://localhost:5173
2. Browse companions
3. Click "Start Call" on any companion
4. Grant camera/microphone permissions
5. Start chatting with your AI companion

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot create room" Error
This was caused by missing database tables. Now fixed.

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure Supabase credentials are correct in both frontend and backend .env files
- Check that users are properly authenticated before making API calls

### WebRTC Connection Issues
- Ensure backend WebSocket server is running
- Check browser console for WebRTC errors
- Verify firewall allows WebRTC connections
